# Lab Assignment 9 & 10 Project Files

This directory contains files generated and used during Lab Assignment 9 for the CS202 - Software Tools and Techniques for CSE course. Below is a description of each file, grouped by analysis type.

## Python Dependency Analysis

- `dependencies.json`: JSON file generated by `pydeps` with detailed dependency information for the HTTPie Python project.

- `dependencies.svg`: SVG image file representing the visual dependency graph generated by `pydeps` for the HTTPie project.

- `dependency_analysis.txt`: Text file containing the analysis of dependencies based on the `pydeps` output for the HTTPie project.

- `dependency_analyzer.py`: Python script used to analyze and process dependency data from the `pydeps` output.

- `fan_analysis.txt`: Text file containing the analysis of fan-in and fan-out metrics derived from the HTTPie dependency graph.

- `fan_in_out.py`: Python script used to calculate and analyze fan-in and fan-out metrics for the HTTPie project.


## LCOM Analysis

- `TypeMetrics.csv`: CSV file containing LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) metrics output from the `LCOM.jar` analysis of the Apache Commons Collections Java project.

- `a6.py`: Python script used for Activity 6 , analyzing high LCOM values.

- `a7.py`: Python script used for Activity 7,.

- `lcom_activity6_analysis.csv`: CSV file containing the results of Activity 6, listing classes with high LCOM values from the `TypeMetrics.csv` data.

- `lcom_activity6_analysis.txt`: Text file with the analysis and notes for Activity 6, detailing high LCOM classes.

- `lcom_activity7_table.csv`: CSV file containing the tabulated LCOM values for the top classes as part of Activity 7.

- `lcom_activity7_table.txt`: Text file with the tabulated LCOM values and comparison notes for Activity 7.

These files collectively document the dependency analysis of the HTTPie Python project and the cohesion analysis of the Apache Commons Collections Java project.
